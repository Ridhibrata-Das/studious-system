# E-Bhoomi: AI-Powered Hyperspectral Imaging Platform for Precision Agriculture

## Project Overview

E-Bhoomi is a comprehensive smart agriculture platform that revolutionizes crop monitoring and management through advanced hyperspectral imaging, real-time IoT sensor integration, and AI-powered decision support systems. Our platform addresses the critical challenges faced by modern agriculture: soil degradation, unpredictable weather patterns, pest outbreaks, and the need for precision farming techniques that maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact.

## Core Innovation: Hyperspectral Imaging Technology

### What We're Doing

We've developed a sophisticated hyperspectral imaging system that captures detailed spectral signatures of agricultural fields using drone-mounted sensors. Unlike traditional RGB imaging, our system captures reflectance data across hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, enabling pixel-level classification of crops, soil, weeds, and other land cover types. This granular analysis allows farmers to identify stress conditions, nutrient deficiencies, and pest infestations at the earliest stages.

### How We're Doing It

**Three-Tier Machine Learning Architecture:**

1. **SSUN (Spectral-Spatial Unified Network)**: Our flagship joint model that combines spectral and spatial information for comprehensive analysis. It processes both the spectral signatures of individual pixels and the spatial context of surrounding areas, achieving superior accuracy in crop classification.

2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Specialized for spectral analysis, this model excels at detecting temporal patterns in crop health by analyzing the spectral evolution of vegetation over time.

3. **MSCNN (Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network)**: Optimized for spatial analysis, this model identifies spatial patterns and textures that indicate crop health, disease presence, or soil conditions.

**Advanced Data Processing Pipeline:**
- **PCA Normalization**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving critical spectral information
- **Mirror Padding**: Ensures consistent spatial context for edge pixels
- **Feature Normalization**: Standardizes input data for optimal model performance
- **Random Image Selection**: Dynamically selects different field regions for analysis, providing comprehensive coverage

## Real-Time IoT Integration

### What We're Doing

We integrate live environmental sensor data with hyperspectral analysis to provide contextualized insights. Our system continuously monitors soil moisture, temperature, humidity, NPK levels, and pH, creating a comprehensive environmental profile that enhances the accuracy of our AI recommendations.

### How We're Doing It

**Multi-Source Data Fusion:**
- **ThingSpeak Integration**: Real-time telemetry from field sensors
- **Weather API Integration**: Open-Meteo for meteorological data
- **Bhuvan NSRC Integration**: Evapotranspiration and evaporation data from ISRO's satellite network
- **Geolocation Services**: Automatic field location detection for localized recommendations

**Intelligent Data Processing:**
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Automated alert system for critical parameter deviations
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data analysis for predictive insights
- **Cross-Validation**: Sensor data validation against hyperspectral findings

## AI-Powered Decision Support
